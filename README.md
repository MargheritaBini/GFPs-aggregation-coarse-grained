# Combining Coarse-Grained Molecular Dynamics with AlphaFold Prediction of Protein Interactions

This repository contains scripts used for generating and analyzing coarse-grained (CG) simulations of protein aggregation, specifically focused on the study of Green Fluorescent Proteins (GFP). 
 
The repository includes two main modules:

1. Input Scripts: Scripts for generating non-bonded interaction parameters for different force fields (CALVADOS, COCOMO, and Trovato).

2. Analysis Scripts: Post-processing tools for analyzing the trajectory data from coarse-grained protein simulations.

## Folder Structure:

- input-scripts: Contains Python scripts for generating non-bonded interaction parameters for CALVADOS, COCOMO, and Trovato force fields.

- analysis-scripts: Contains Python scripts for analyzing protein simulation trajectories (MSD, contacts, contact matrix).

## Getting Started:
To use the scripts, follow the instructions in the respective `README.md` files inside each folder.
